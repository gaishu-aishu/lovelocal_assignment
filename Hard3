/*Explaination
     
    This Java program computes the total count of the digit '1' that appears in the range from 0 to a given input number 'n', inclusive.
    Method digitcount:

     ->  It takes an integer 'n' as input and returns the count of occurrences of digit '1'.
        The method operates by iterating through each digit position (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.) in the numbers from 0 to 'n'.
     -> For each digit position, it calculates the number of times the digit '1' appears in that position for all the numbers.
     ->This is achieved by dividing the number by increasing powers of 10 and counting the occurrences of '1' in that position using mathematical calculations.
     ->The count for each position is accumulated to get the total count of occurrences of '1' in the entire range of numbers.

    Main Method:

    ->It takes user input for the value of 'n' (the upper limit for the range).
    ->Calls the digitcount method to calculate the total count of occurrences of '1'.
    ->Prints the total count of occurrences of '1' from 0 to 'n'.

    Example:
    For instance, if 'n' is 15, the program would calculate the count of occurrences of '1' from 0 to 15, 
    which is 8 ('1' appears 8 times: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
