//Easy 1
/* Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

//Explaination
/* This code reads the sentance and give the count of the last word of the sentance s
    steps:
    1>Intially the count will be "0".
    2> Take user input i.e.,sentence s
    3> split the sentance according to the word .
    4>Then get the last_index .
    5>from the index we get the last word for the sentence.
    6>using for loop count the letter of the word and then print the word count.
